A quadratic equation is any equation that can be written in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a is not equal to zero. The reason a can't be zero is because if it were, we'd just have bx + c = 0, which is a linear equation, not quadratic. Do you follow so far?"

      "content": "Excellent. Now, there are several methods for solving quadratic equations. The most common are factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula. Today we'll focus on factoring because it's often the fastest method when it works. Factoring means breaking down the quadratic expression into a product of two binomial expressions. For example, x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 can be factored as (x + 2)(x + 3). The key is finding two numbers that multiply to give you the constant term c and add to give you the coefficient b."

Here, a = 1, b = 7, and c = 12. Step two: find two numbers that multiply to c (which is 12) and add to b (which is 7). Let's list the factors of 12: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4. Now we check which pair adds to 7. Well, 1 + 12 = 13, 2 + 6 = 8, and 3 + 4 = 7. So the answer is 3 and 4."

    {
      "role": "tutor",
      "content": "Step three: write the factored form using those numbers. So we get (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0. Step four: use the zero product property. This property states that if the product of two factors equals zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So either x + 3 = 0 or x + 4 = 0. Step five: solve each equation. If x + 3 = 0, then x = -3. If x + 4 = 0, then x = -4. Therefore, the solutions are x = -3 and x = -4. You can always verify by substituting back into the original equation."

The factors of -6 are: 1 and -6, -1 and 6, 2 and -3, -2 and 3. Checking the sums: 1 + (-6) = -5, (-1) + 6 = 5, 2 + (-3) = -1. There we go! So the numbers are 2 and -3."

The most important thing to remember is the systematic process: identify your coefficients, find the right pair of factors, write the factored form, apply the zero product property, and solve. Does this all make sense?"
