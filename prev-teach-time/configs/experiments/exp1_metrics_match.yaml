# Experiment 1: Pedagogical Metrics Match
#
# Goal: Compare Baseline-CoT, Metric-CoT, and ReAct-Teacher on their ability
# to match target teaching metrics (student talk ratio, questions, background
# probing, understanding checks).

name: "exp1_metrics_match"

# Domain
domain: "mathematics"

# Tasks to use (sample from these)
tasks:
  - linear_equations
  - fraction_operations

# Student personas

# Agents to compare
agents:
  - baseline_cot
  - metric_cot
  - react_teacher

# Number of episodes per (task, student, agent) combination

description: |
  Compare agents on pedagogical behavior match. Analyze distributions of:
  - Student talk ratio
  - Number of questions asked
  - Time until background probed
  - Frequency of understanding checks
