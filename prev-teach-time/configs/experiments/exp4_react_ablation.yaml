# Experiment 4: Ablation - ReAct With/Without Metrics
#
# Goal: Decompose the contribution of (a) ReAct structure vs (b) metric awareness.
# Is it the ReAct framework or the explicit metrics that matter more?

name: "exp4_react_ablation"

# Domain
domain: "mathematics"

# Tasks to use
tasks:
  - linear_equations
  - fraction_operations

# Student personas
students:
  - struggling
  - confident_mistaken

# Ablation variants
agents:
  - react_teacher              # Full: ReAct + metrics
  - react_teacher_no_metrics   # ReAct structure without metrics
  - baseline_cot               # No ReAct, no metrics (reference)

# Number of episodes per (task, student, agent) combination
num_episodes_per_condition: 50

description: |
  Ablation study to understand:
  - Does ReAct structure help without metrics?
  - Does metrics awareness contribute independently?
  - Interaction between ReAct and metrics

  Agents compared:
  1. react_teacher: Full model (ReAct + metrics)
  2. react_teacher_no_metrics: ReAct without metric observation
  3. baseline_cot: Neither ReAct nor metrics

  Analyze pedagogy scores, learning gains, and action diversity.
