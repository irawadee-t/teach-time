# Experiment 3: Robustness Across Student Personas
#
# Goal: Test robustness of tutoring strategies across diverse student behaviors.
# Does ReAct-Teacher adapt better to different student types compared to baselines?

# Output
description: |
  Test adaptation to different student personas. Analyze:
  - Agent × persona performance matrix (heatmap)
  - Which agent degrades least across personas?
  - Interaction effects (agent × persona on learning gain)

  Personas:
  - Struggling: High confusion, needs multiple explanations
  - Confident but mistaken: Systematic misconceptions
  - Minimal talker: Terse responses, low talk ratio challenge
