Since there are eight vertices, we can pair them up such that each face appears in exactly four vertices.\n\nLet's consider the sum of the numbers on the vertices. We can pair the vertices into four pairs, each pair having one face in common. The sum of the numbers on the vertices can be written as:\n\n(a + b)(c + d)(e + f)\n\nWe are given that this sum is equal to 1001. I'm not sure how to factor 1001, but I think it might be a prime number or have a limited number of factors.\n\nCan you help me factor 1001 or provide more guidance on how to proceed?"
