There are 4 females, so there are 4 ways to choose the female lead.\n\nNext, we need to choose the male lead. There are 4 males (since there are 8 members in total and 4 are females), so there are 4 ways to choose the male lead.\n\nNow, we have 6 members left (since 2 have already been assigned roles), and we need to assign 3 different objects to them. The order in which we assign these objects matters, since each object is different. We can choose the first object in 6 ways, the second object in 5 ways (since one member has already been assigned an object), and the third object in 4 ways.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to assign the roles, we multiply the number of ways to choose each role: 4 (female lead) * 4 (male lead) * 6 (first object) * 5 (second object) * 4 (third object).\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is the correct approach, as I haven't considered whether the objects can be played by either gender. Does this affect the calculation?"

      "Limited question depth (lacks conceptual/metacognitive questions; score 3/5)",
      "Weak background knowledge assessment (score 1/5; may lead to gaps in foundational understanding)"

    "recommendations": [
      "Incorporate deeper questions (e.g., 'Why does this method work?' or 'How would you approach this problem differently?') to boost conceptual/metacognitive depth",
      "Pre-assess prior knowledge explicitly (e.g., 'What do you already know about this topic?') before diving into content",
      "Balance constructive engagement with occasional interactive pauses to check comprehension (e.g., 'Can you summarize what we\u2019ve covered so far?')"
