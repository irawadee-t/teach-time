The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nThe greatest common factor is the largest number in this list.

  "evaluation": {
    "overall_quality": "good",
    "summary": "This tutoring session excels in engagement quality and supportive dialogue but would benefit from deeper questioning techniques and better knowledge scaffolding. The strong constructive/interactive engagement (75% combined) suggests good pedagogical rapport, while the shallow question depth limits higher-order thinking opportunities.",
    "strengths": [
      "High-quality error feedback and encouragement",
      "Strong student engagement (ICAP classification shows constructive/interactive dominance)",
      "Excellent coherence and relevance in responses"

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Limited question depth (over-reliance on recall-level questions)",
      "Weak background knowledge assessment (missed opportunities to connect to prior learning)",
      "Need for more conceptual/metacognitive questioning"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Incorporate more 'why' and 'how' questions to deepen conceptual understanding (e.g., 'How would you explain this concept to a peer?')",
      "Begin sessions with 1-2 diagnostic questions to assess prerequisite knowledge",
      "Use think-aloud prompts to surface metacognition (e.g., 'What strategy did you use here?')"
