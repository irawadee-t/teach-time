OVERALL PEDAGOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS SCORE (PES)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Score: 72.5/100
Category: Good
Quality: good

Summary: This tutoring session excels in fostering active student participation and maintaining highly relevant dialogue, but could significantly enhance learning outcomes by addressing foundational knowledge gaps and pushing for deeper cognitive engagement through strategic questioning.

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strengths:
  1. High student engagement (ICAP score: 5/5 with constructive and interactive dominance)
  2. Strong response relevance and student talk ratio (both 5/5), indicating focused and student-centered dialogue
  3. Effective error feedback and appropriate guidance (both 4/5), supporting learning without over-directing

Areas for Improvement:
  1. Limited question depth (score: 3/5), with no metacognitive or conceptual questions to promote deeper thinking
  2. Weak background knowledge assessment (1/5), risking potential gaps in foundational understanding
  3. Over-reliance on procedural questions (2/3 of question depth distribution), missing opportunities for higher-order thinking

Recommendations:
  1. Incorporate metacognitive prompts (e.g., 'How would you approach this type of problem in the future?') to deepen reflection
  2. Begin sessions with 1-2 quick background knowledge checks (e.g., 'What do you already know about X?') to tailor explanations
  3. Balance procedural questions with conceptual ones (e.g., 'Why does this method work?' vs. 'How do you solve this?')

DETAILED SCORE BREAKDOWN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAYER 1: 8-Dimension Tutor Response Quality (80% weight)
Layer Score: 0.719
Weighted Contribution: 57.50/100

  Comprehension Probing: 4/5
    The tutor effectively probes comprehension by asking targeted questions that guide the student to identify and correct their mistakes. However, there is one missed opportunity to probe deeper when the student initially questions their application of the residue theorem.
    Evidence: Turn 2 [TUTOR]: 'You've correctly identified the residues as 2 and 3, but check your final multiplic...

  Background Knowledge Assessment: 1/5
    The tutor makes no attempt to assess the student's background knowledge at any point in the conversation. The tutor jumps straight into addressing the student's specific question about the integral and residue theorem without first understanding the student's prior knowledge on the topic.
    Evidence: Turn 2 [TUTOR]: You've correctly identified the residues as 2 and 3, but check your final multiplica...

  Appropriate Guidance Level: 4/5
    The tutor provides mostly appropriate guidance, maintaining productive struggle while occasionally nudging the student towards the correct answer. However, in Turn 4, the tutor slightly gives away the answer by explicitly stating '10πi = (10π)i', which reduces the cognitive load on the student.
    Evidence: Turn 2: 'You've correctly identified the residues as 2 and 3, but check your final multiplication - ...

  Error Feedback Quality: 4/5
    The tutor provides explanatory feedback that helps the student understand their errors, but the initial hint could have been more detailed to immediately clarify the confusion about the coefficient A.
    Evidence: You've correctly identified the residues as 2 and 3, but check your final multiplication - what is 2...

  Encouragement & Tone: 4/5
    The tutor is generally supportive and encouraging, with a positive tone. However, there are minor lapses where the tutor could have been warmer or more celebratory of the student's progress.
    Evidence: You've correctly identified the residues as 2 and 3, but check your final multiplication - what is 2...

  Response Coherence: 4/5
    The tutor's responses are mostly clear and coherent, guiding the student effectively. However, there is a minor moment in Turn 4 where the tutor could have been more explicit about the form of the answer (Ai) to avoid initial confusion.
    Evidence: Turn 2: 'You've correctly identified the residues as 2 and 3, but check your final multiplication - ...

  Response Relevance: 5/5
    The tutor's responses consistently and directly address the student's questions and learning needs, guiding them to correct their mistakes and understand the application of the residue theorem. There are no tangents or irrelevant information.
    Evidence: Turn 2 [TUTOR]: You've correctly identified the residues as 2 and 3, but check your final multiplica...

  Student Talk Ratio: 5/5
    The student contributes the majority of the dialogue, providing detailed steps and reasoning. The tutor's questions are concise and guide the student to correct their own mistakes, ensuring the student does most of the cognitive work.
    Evidence: Turn 1 [STUDENT]: To compute the integral, I'll first try to break down the integrand into partial f...

LAYER 2: Question Depth Analysis (10% weight)
Layer Score: 0.500
Weighted Contribution: 5.00/100
Raw Score: 3/5
Question Distribution: {'recall': 0, 'procedural': 2, 'conceptual': 0, 'metacognitive': 0}
Justification: The tutor's questions are primarily procedural, focusing on guiding the student through the steps of applying the residue theorem and interpreting the final answer. There are no recall, conceptual, or metacognitive questions. While the procedural questions are effective in helping the student correct their calculations, the lack of deeper questions (conceptual or metacognitive) limits the overall depth of the tutoring interaction. Thus, the score is '3 (Adequate)' as the questions are mostly procedural with no deeper exploration.

LAYER 3: ICAP Student Engagement (10% weight)
Layer Score: 1.000
Weighted Contribution: 10.00/100
Raw Score: 5/5
Engagement Distribution: {'passive': 0, 'active': 0, 'constructive': 67, 'interactive': 33}
Justification: The student's engagement is primarily Constructive (67%) and Interactive (33%), with no Passive or Active engagement. In Turn 1, the student constructs a detailed solution and reflects on potential errors (Constructive). In Turn 3, they identify and correct a mistake independently (Constructive). In Turn 5, they respond to the tutor's prompt, co-constructing the final answer (Interactive). This aligns with a score of 5 (Excellent) under the ICAP framework.
