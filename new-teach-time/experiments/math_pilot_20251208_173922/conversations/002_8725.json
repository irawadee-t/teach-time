There are 4 females, so there are 4 ways to choose the female lead.\n\nNext, we need to choose the male lead. There are 4 males (since there are 8 members in total and 4 are females), so there are 4 ways to choose the male lead.\n\nNow, we have 6 members left (since 2 have already been assigned roles), and we need to assign 3 different objects to them. The order in which we assign these objects matters, since each object is different. We can choose the first object in 6 ways, the second object in 5 ways (since one member has already been assigned an object), and the third object in 4 ways.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to assign the roles, we multiply the number of ways to choose each role: 4 (female lead) * 4 (male lead) * 6 (first object) * 5 (second object) * 4 (third object).\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is the correct approach, as I haven't considered whether the objects can be played by either gender. Does this affect the calculation?"
