Since there are 8 vertices, we can pair them up such that each face appears in exactly 4 vertices.\n\nLet's consider the sum of the numbers on the vertices. We can pair the vertices as follows:\n\n- (a, b, c) and (d, e, f)\n- (a, b, d) and (c, e, f)\n- (a, c, e) and (b, d, f)\n- (a, f, d) and (b, c, e)\n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to the sum of the products of the three adjacent faces. Since each face appears in exactly 4 vertices, we can factor out each face from the sum.\n\nLet's denote the sum of the numbers on the vertices as S. Then we can write:\n\nS = (a + d)(b + e)(c + f)\n\nWe are given that S = 1001. Now, we need to find the sum of the numbers written on the faces, which is a + b + c + d + e + f.\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. Can you give me a hint or guidance on how to factor 1001 into three factors that can be expressed as the sum of two numbers?"

Now, I need to find pairs of numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two of these primes.\n\nOne possible pair is 7 + 11 = 18, but I'm not sure if this is the correct pair. Another possible pair is 7 + 13 = 20, and 11 + 13 = 24.\n\nHowever, I think I can try to find a combination that works. Let's say (a + d) = 7 + 11 = 18, (b + e) = 7 + 13 = 20, and (c + f) = 11 + 13 = 24.\n\nIf this combination works, then the sum of the numbers written on the faces would be a + b + c + d + e + f = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) - (a + b + c + d + e + f) + (a + b + c + d + e + f). But this is just (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f).\n\nSo, the sum of the numbers written on the faces would be 18 + 20 + 24 = 62.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is the correct solution, but I think I'm on the right track.

The correct calculation for the sum of the numbers written on the faces is indeed (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f), but you need to subtract the sum of all six numbers (a + b + c + d + e + f) from this sum.\n\nHowever, you correctly simplified the expression to (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f). Now, let's focus on finding the correct values for (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f).\n\nNotice that the pairs you found earlier, (7 + 11), (7 + 13), and (11 + 13), are not the correct pairs. Instead, you need to find pairs of numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two of the prime factors of 1001.\n\nCan you think of any other combinations of the prime factors 7, 11, and 13 that could work?"
