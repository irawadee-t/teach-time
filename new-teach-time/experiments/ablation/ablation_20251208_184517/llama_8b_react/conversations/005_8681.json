The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nI think the greatest common factor is the largest number in the list of common factors. So, I'm going to take a guess that the GCF is 18. However, I'm not entirely sure if I've done it correctly.\n\nCan you please confirm or provide more guidance?"

      "role": "student",
      "content": "If we look at the multiples of the common factors, I think it could help us confirm the greatest common factor.\n\nLet's try it with the common factors I found earlier: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nIf we multiply each of these common factors by some integer, we should get a multiple of that factor that is also a multiple of both 36 and 90.\n\nFor example, if we take the common factor 18, we can see that 18 \u00d7 2 = 36 and 18 \u00d7 5 = 90. This shows that 18 is indeed a common factor of both 36 and 90.\n\nIf we try this with the other common factors, we might find that some of them don't work as well. For instance, if we take the common factor 9, we can see that 9 \u00d7 4 = 36, but 9 \u00d7 10 = 90. This also works, but it doesn't tell us anything new.\n\nHowever, if we try to find a multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of both 36 and 90, we can see that 18 is the largest number that satisfies this condition.\n\nI think this exercise has helped me confirm that the greatest common factor is indeed 18. But I'd like to make sure I'm correct.\n\nCan I submit my answer now, or is there anything else I should consider?"

Let's try listing the multiples of each common factor and see if any other common factor appears in both lists.\n\nFor the common factor 1, the multiples are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, ...\n\nFor the common factor 2, the multiples are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, ...\n\nFor the common factor 3, the multiples are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, ...\n\nFor the common factor 6, the multiples are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, ...\n\nFor the common factor 9, the multiples are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, ...\n\nFor the common factor 18, the multiples are: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, ...\n\nNow, let's compare the lists. We can see that the multiples of 18 are also multiples of 6, 9, and other common factors. However, we don't see any other common factor that appears in both lists of multiples"

This means that the greatest common factor must be a factor of both 36 and 90, and it must be the largest number that appears in the lists of multiples for both 36 and 90.\n\nLooking at the lists of multiples I generated earlier, I notice that 18 is the largest number that appears in the lists of multiples for both 36 and 90. This means that 18 is the largest number that divides both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder.\n\nI'm confident now that the greatest common factor of 36 and 90 is indeed 18.\n\nFINAL: 18"
