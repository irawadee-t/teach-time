      "content": "Let's denote the numbers on the faces as a, b, c, d, e, and f. Each vertex is the product of three adjacent faces. Since there are 8 vertices, we can pair them up such that each face appears in exactly 4 vertices.\n\nLet's consider the sum of the numbers on the vertices. We can pair the vertices into 4 pairs, each pair having one face in common. For example, one pair could be the vertices with faces a, b, and c, and the vertices with faces a, d, and e.\n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices can be written as:\n\nabc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def\n\nWe can factor out the common terms:\n\na(b + e)(c + f) + d(b + e)(c + f)\n\nNow, we can factor out (b + e)(c + f):\n\n(a + d)(b + e)(c + f)\n\nWe are given that the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to 1001. So, we can write:\n\n(a + d)(b + e)(c + f) = 1001\n\nSince 1001 = 7 * 11 * 13, we can deduce that (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) are equal to 7, 11, and 13 in some order.\n\nNow, I'm unsure about how to proceed. Should we try to find the individual values of a, b, c, d, e, and f, or is there a simpler way to find the sum of the numbers written on the faces?"

We still need to consider the individual values of a, b, c, d, e, and f.\n\nWait, I think I see a connection. Since (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) are the sums of opposite faces, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is actually the sum of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f).\n\nSo, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is indeed 31. Am I correct?"

      "content": "Since each face appears in exactly 4 vertices, each face is counted 4 times in the sum of the numbers on the vertices. However, when we factored the sum into (a + d)(b + e)(c + f), we didn't count each face individually.\n\nInstead, we paired up the faces into opposite pairs, and each pair was counted once in the sum. This means that the sum of the numbers written on the faces is actually the sum of the individual faces, not the sum of the pairs.\n\nSince we know that (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) are equal to 7, 11, and 13 in some order, we can say that the sum of the numbers written on the faces is:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f)\n\nBut we already know that (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31.\n\nSo, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is indeed 31. I'm confident in this answer now.\n\nFINAL: 31"
