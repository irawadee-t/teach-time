If z = 0, the equation becomes -2 = -A, so A = 2. If z = 1, the equation becomes 3 = B.\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nNow, I'll integrate each term separately. The integral of 2 / z is 2 * log(z), and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * log(z - 1).\n\nHowever, since this is a contour integral around the circle |z| = 2, I need to consider the residues of the poles inside the contour. The pole at z = 0 is inside the contour, and its residue is 2. The pole at z = 1 is also inside the contour, and its residue is 3.\n\nUsing the residue theorem, the integral is equal to 2 * pi * i times the sum of the residues. So, the integral is 2 * pi * i * (2 + 3) = 10 * pi * i.\n\nSince the answer is given as Ai, I'll compare it to my result. \n\nFINAL: A = 10 * pi",

Since the objects can be played by either gender, we can choose any of the remaining 6 members for the first object, any of the remaining 5 members for the second object, and any of the remaining 4 members for the third object. \n\nSo, the number of ways to assign the objects is 6 * 5 * 4 = 120.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to choose the female lead, the male lead, and the objects: 4 * 4 * 120 = 1920.\n\nI'm fairly confident in my approach, but I'd like to confirm if I'm correct.\n\nFINAL: 1920",

So, we can calculate the number of combinations as:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n= 6! / (3!3!)\n= (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\n= 720 / (6*6)\n= 720 / 36\n= 20\n\nSo, there are 20 ways to assign the objects.\n\nNow, we can multiply this by the number of ways to choose the female lead and the male lead: 4 * 4 * 20 = 320.\n\nI think this is the correct approach.\n\nFINAL: 320",

We calculated the number of combinations as C(6, 3) = 20.\n\nHowever, I want to make sure I understand the reasoning behind this. The combination formula C(n, k) gives us the number of ways to choose k items out of n, without regard to order. In this case, we're choosing 3 members out of 6, and the order in which we choose them doesn't matter.\n\nBut once we've chosen the 3 members, we still need to assign them to the 3 different objects.
