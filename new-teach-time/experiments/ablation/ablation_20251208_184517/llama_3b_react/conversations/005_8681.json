The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nThe greatest common factor is the largest number in this list. I think the GCF is 18, but I'm not entirely sure if I've done it correctly.\n\nCould you please confirm or provide guidance?"

    {
      "role": "student",
      "content": "I think I can see why 1, 2, and 3 might not be the greatest common factor. It's because there are larger numbers that are also common factors of 36 and 90. In this case, 6, 9, and 18 are all larger than 1, 2, and 3.\n\nI'm pretty sure that the greatest common factor should be the largest number that divides both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder. Since 6, 9, and 18 are all larger than 1, 2, and 3, and they all divide both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder, I think one of these numbers should be the greatest common factor.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure which one is the greatest common factor. Is it 6, 9, or 18?"

To find the greatest common factor, I need to find the largest number that divides both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder.\n\nI can see that 6, 9, and 18 are all larger than 1, 2, and 3, and they all divide both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder. But I need to find the largest one.\n\nI think I can eliminate 6 because 9 is larger and also divides both 36 and 90. And I think I can eliminate 9 because 18 is larger and also divides both 36 and 90.\n\nSo, I'm left with 18. I think 18 is the largest number that divides both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder.\n\nFINAL: 18"
