Since there are 8 vertices, we can pair them up such that each face appears in exactly 4 vertices.\n\nLet's consider the pairs of opposite faces: (a, d), (b, e), and (c, f). Each vertex is the product of one face from each pair. The sum of the numbers on the vertices can be expressed as:\n\n(a + d)(b + e)(c + f) = 1001\n\nWe know that 1001 = 7 * 11 * 13. Since the numbers on the faces are positive integers, we can try to find a combination of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) that multiplies to 1001.\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here.
