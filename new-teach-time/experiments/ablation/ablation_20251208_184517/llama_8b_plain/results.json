If z = 0, the equation becomes -2 = -A, so A = 2. If z = 1, the equation becomes 3 = B.\n\nSo, the integrand becomes 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nNow, I'll use the Cauchy Integral Formula, which states that the integral of f(z) / (z - a) around a closed curve is 2\u03c0i * f(a).\n\nIn this case, I have two terms: 2 / z and 3 / (z - 1). The first term has a pole at z = 0, and the second term has a pole at z = 1. Since the curve |z| = 2 encloses both poles, I can apply the Cauchy Integral Formula to both terms.\n\nThe integral of 2 / z around the curve is 2\u03c0i * 2 = 4\u03c0i.\n\nThe integral of 3 / (z - 1) around the curve is 2\u03c0i * 3 = 6\u03c0i.\n\nSo, the total integral is 4\u03c0i + 6\u03c0i = 10\u03c0i.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is the correct answer, as the problem statement says the answer is Ai with i denoting the imaginary unit.
