This gives 5z - 2 = A(z - 1) + Bz.\n\nNext, I'll equate coefficients. Setting z = 0, I get -2 = -A, so A = 2. Setting z = 1, I get 3 = B.\n\nNow, I have (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nThe integral becomes \u222b(2 / z + 3 / (z - 1)) dz.\n\nSince the integral is taken over a closed curve |z| = 2, I can use Cauchy's integral formula. The function 1 / z has a pole at z = 0, which is inside the curve, and the function 1 / (z - 1) has a pole at z = 1, which is also inside the curve.\n\nUsing Cauchy's integral formula, I get \u222b(2 / z + 3 / (z - 1)) dz = 2 * 2\u03c0i + 3 * 2\u03c0i.\n\nCombining the terms, I get \u222b(2 / z + 3 / (z - 1)) dz = 10\u03c0i.\n\nSince the answer is given as Ai, I'll compare it to my result. \n\nI think A is 10\u03c0, but I'm not sure if I should include the \u03c0 in the answer.",
