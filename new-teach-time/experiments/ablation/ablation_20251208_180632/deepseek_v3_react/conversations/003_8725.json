Since there are four females, there are 4 ways to choose the female lead.\n\nNext, we need to choose the male lead. There are 4 males (since there are 8 members in total and 4 are females), so there are 4 ways to choose the male lead.\n\nNow, we have 6 members left (since 2 have already been assigned roles), and we need to assign them to 3 different objects. The order in which we assign these objects matters, so we need to use permutations. There are 6 choices for the first object, 5 choices for the second object, and 4 choices for the third object.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to assign the roles is: \n4 (ways to choose female lead) * 4 (ways to choose male lead) * 6 (choices for first object) * 5 (choices for second object) * 4 (choices for third object) = 4 * 4 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 1920.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is the correct answer. Could you please confirm or provide guidance?"

      "content": "Your reasoning is correct! You've properly accounted for the female lead, male lead, and the permutation of remaining members for the objects. The calculation of 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 indeed equals 1920. What makes you doubt this answer?"

      "content": "I'm glad to hear that my reasoning is correct. I doubted the answer because I'm not used to dealing with such large numbers in permutations, and I was worried that I might have missed something or made a calculation error. However, now that you've confirmed my reasoning and calculation, I'm confident in my answer.\n\nFINAL: 1920"
