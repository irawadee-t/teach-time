If z = 0, the equation becomes -2 = -A, so A = 2. If z = 1, the equation becomes 3 = B.\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nNow, I'll integrate each term separately. The integral of 2 / z is 2 * log(z), and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * log(z - 1).\n\nHowever, since this is a contour integral around the circle |z| = 2, I need to consider the residues of the poles inside the contour. The pole at z = 0 is inside the contour, and its residue is 2. The pole at z = 1 is also inside the contour, and its residue is 3.\n\nUsing the residue theorem, the integral is equal to 2 * pi * i * (2 + 3) = 10 * pi * i.\n\nBut the answer is given as Ai, so I'll try to match the two expressions. \n\nIs the answer A = 10 * pi?",

There are 4 males (since there are 8 members in total and 4 are females), so there are 4 ways to choose the male lead.\n\nNow, we have 6 members left (since 2 have already been assigned roles), and we need to assign them to 3 different objects. The order in which we assign these objects matters, so we need to use permutations. There are 6 choices for the first object, 5 choices for the second object, and 4 choices for the third object.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to assign the roles is: \n4 (ways to choose female lead) * 4 (ways to choose male lead) * 6 (choices for first object) * 5 (choices for second object) * 4 (choices for third object) = 4 * 4 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 1920.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is the correct answer.
