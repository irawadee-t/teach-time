      "content": "To compute the integral, I'll first try to break down the integrand into partial fractions. \n\nLet's rewrite the integrand as (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = A / z + B / (z - 1). \n\nTo find A and B, I'll multiply both sides by z * (z - 1) to get 5z - 2 = A(z - 1) + Bz.\n\nNow, I'll try to find A and B by choosing suitable values for z. If z = 0, the equation becomes -2 = -A, so A = 2. If z = 1, the equation becomes 3 = B.\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nNow, I'll integrate each term separately. The integral of 2 / z is 2 * log(z), and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * log(z - 1).\n\nHowever, since this is a contour integral around the circle |z| = 2, I need to consider the residues of the poles inside the contour. The pole at z = 0 is inside the contour, and its residue is 2. The pole at z = 1 is also inside the contour, and its residue is 3.\n\nUsing the residue theorem, the integral is equal to 2 * pi * i * (2 + 3) = 10 * pi * i.\n\nBut the answer is given as Ai, so I'll try to match the given answer. \n\nIs the answer A = 10 * pi?"

You correctly identified the residues as 2 and 3. \n\nBut 2 + 3 = 5, so shouldn't the integral be 2\u03c0i * 5 = 10\u03c0i? \n\nGiven that the answer is Ai, what would A be in this case?
