Since there are 8 vertices, we can pair them up such that each face appears in exactly 4 vertices. \n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to the sum of the products of the three adjacent faces. We can pair the vertices as follows: (a, b, c) and (d, e, f), (a, b, f) and (d, e, c), (a, c, e) and (d, b, f), and (a, f, e) and (d, b, c).\n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is then: \n(a + d)(b + e)(c + f) = 1001.\n\nNow, I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Can you give me a hint on how to factor 1001 and relate it to the sum of the numbers on the faces?"

That might help us understand what (a+d), (b+e), and (c+f) could be. \n\nAlso, remember that a, b, c, d, e, f are positive integers. What does that tell us about the possible values of (a+d), (b+e), and (c+f)?"

Since a, b, c, d, e, f are positive integers, (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) must also be positive integers.\n\nGiven the prime factorization of 1001, it seems likely that (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) are 7, 11, and 13, in some order. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure how to assign these values to (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) or how to find the individual values of a, b, c, d, e, and f. Can you give me another hint on how to proceed?"

      "content": "Excellent progress! You're correct that the factors must be 7, 11, and 13 in some order. \n\nNow, think about what we're ultimately trying to find: the sum of all face numbers (a + b + c + d + e + f). How can you express this sum in terms of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f)? \n\nWhat would you get if you added (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f)?"

Let me try again.\n\n(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = a + d + b + e + c + f\n\nThis is actually the sum of all face numbers, but with each number appearing twice. So, we can express the sum of all face numbers as:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) / 2\n\nHowever, since we know that (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) are 7, 11, and 13, we can simply add them up and divide by 2 to get the sum of all face numbers.\n\n(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31\n\nSo, the sum of all face numbers is:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f = 31 / 2 * 2 = 31\n\nFINAL: 31"
