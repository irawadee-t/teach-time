If z = 0, the equation becomes -2 = -A, so A = 2. If z = 1, the equation becomes 3 = B.\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nNow, I'll integrate each term separately. The integral of 2 / z is 2 * log(z), and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * log(z - 1).\n\nHowever, since this is a contour integral around the circle |z| = 2, I need to consider the residues of the poles inside the contour.

You're correct that the factors must be 7, 11, and 13 in some order. \n\nNow, think about what we're ultimately trying to find: the sum of all face numbers (a + b + c + d + e + f). How can you express this sum in terms of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f)? \n\nWhat would you get if you added (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f)?",

Let me try again.\n\n(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = a + d + b + e + c + f\n\nThis is actually the sum of all face numbers, but with each number appearing twice. So, we can express the sum of all face numbers as:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) / 2\n\nHowever, since we know that (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) are 7, 11, and 13, we can simply add them up and divide by 2 to get the sum of all face numbers.\n\n(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31\n\nSo, the sum of all face numbers is:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f = 31 / 2 * 2 = 31\n\nFINAL: 31",
