If z = 0, the equation becomes -2 = -A, so A = 2. If z = 1, the equation becomes 3 = B.\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nNow, I'll integrate each term separately. The integral of 2 / z is 2 * log(z), and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * log(z - 1).\n\nHowever, since this is a contour integral around the circle |z| = 2, I need to consider the residues of the poles inside the contour. The pole at z = 0 is inside the contour, and its residue is 2. The pole at z = 1 is also inside the contour, and its residue is 3.\n\nUsing the residue theorem, the integral is equal to 2 * pi * i * (2 + 3) = 10 * pi * i.\n\nBut the answer is given as Ai, so A must be 10 * pi.",

There are 4 females, so there are 4 ways to choose the female lead.\n\nNext, we need to choose the male lead. Since there are 4 females, there are 4 males (8 total members - 4 females). So, there are 4 ways to choose the male lead.\n\nNow, we have 6 members left (8 total members - 2 leads chosen). We need to assign 3 different objects to these 6 members. This is a permutation problem since the order matters (assigning object A to person 1 is different from assigning object A to person 2). We have 6 choices for the first object, 5 choices for the second object, and 4 choices for the third object.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to assign the roles is: \n4 (female lead) * 4 (male lead) * 6 (first object) * 5 (second object) * 4 (third object) = ?\n\nI'm not sure if I've done the calculation correctly, but I'll try to calculate it. \n4 * 4 = 16\n16 * 6 = 96\n96 * 5 = 480\n480 * 4 = 1920\n\nIs this correct?",
