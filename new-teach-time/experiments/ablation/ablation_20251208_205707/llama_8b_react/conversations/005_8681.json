The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nThe greatest common factor is the largest number in this list. I think the GCF is 18, but I'm not entirely sure if I've done it correctly.\n\nCan you please confirm or provide guidance on my approach?"

    },
    {
      "role": "student",
      "content": "I think 18 is the largest number in the list of common factors because any number larger than 18 that is a factor of 36 would not be a factor of 90, and vice versa.\n\nFor example, if I look at the next multiple of 18, which is 36, I see that 36 is a factor of 36, but it's not a factor of 90. Similarly, if I look at the next multiple of 18 that is a factor of 90, which is 36 (but 36 is not a factor of 90), I see that 36 is not a common factor.\n\nI'm starting to feel more confident that 18 is indeed the greatest common factor. But I'd love to hear your confirmation or any additional insights you might have.\n\nFINAL: 18"

      "content": "You're on the right track. Your reasoning about the multiples of 18 is correct, but let's focus on the fact that 18 is the largest number in the list of common factors. We can confirm this by looking at the list itself. What do you see when you compare the numbers in the list of common factors?"
    },
    {
      "role": "student",
      "content": "When I look at the list of common factors, I see that 18 is indeed the largest number in the list. I can see that 18 is greater than 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9.\n\nIn other words, there is no other number in the list of common factors that is larger than 18. This makes sense, because if there were a larger number in the list, it would mean that there is a larger common factor between 36 and 90.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that 18 is the greatest common factor because it is the largest number in the list of common factors.\n\nFINAL: 18"
