The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nThe greatest common factor is the largest number in the list of common factors. In this case, I think the greatest common factor is 18, but I'm not entirely sure if I've done it correctly.\n\nCould you please confirm or provide more guidance?"

      "content": "To confirm that 18 is indeed the greatest common factor, I can try dividing both 36 and 90 by 18.\n\n36 \u00f7 18 = 2 (a whole number)\n90 \u00f7 18 = 5 (a whole number)\n\nSince both divisions result in whole numbers, it seems that 18 is indeed a common factor of both 36 and 90.\n\nHowever, to be absolutely sure that 18 is the greatest common factor, I should also check if there's a larger number that can divide both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me think for a moment... If there was a larger common factor, it would have to be a multiple of 18. But since 36 is less than 2 times 18, and 90 is less than 5 times 18, I'm not sure if there's a larger common factor.\n\nCould you please provide more guidance or help me think this through?"

You mentioned that 36 is less than 2 times 18, and 90 is less than 5 times 18. This suggests that 18 is indeed the largest common factor, but you're being cautious to ensure t..."

Since 36 is less than 2 times 18, and 90 is less than 5 times 18, it's unlikely that there's a larger common factor that can divide both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\nIn fact, if I think about it, any number larger than 18 would not be able to divide 36 without leaving a remainder, since 36 is not a multiple of any number larger than 18.\n\nSo, taking all of this into consideration, I'm starting to feel more confident that 18 is indeed the greatest common factor of 36 and 90.\n\nFINAL: 18"
