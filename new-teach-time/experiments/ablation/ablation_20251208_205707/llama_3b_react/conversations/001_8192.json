This gives 5z - 2 = A(z - 1) + Bz.\n\nNext, I'll equate coefficients. Setting z = 0, I get -2 = -A, so A = 2. Setting z = 1, I get 3 = B.\n\nNow, I have (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nThe integral becomes \u222b(2 / z + 3 / (z - 1)) dz.\n\nUsing the Cauchy Integral Formula, I know that \u222b(1 / z) dz = 2\u03c0i and \u222b(1 / (z - a)) dz = 2\u03c0i, where the contour is a circle centered at a.\n\nSince the contour |z| = 2 encloses both z = 0 and z = 1, I can apply the Cauchy Integral Formula.\n\nSo, \u222b(2 / z + 3 / (z - 1)) dz = 2 * 2\u03c0i + 3 * 2\u03c0i = 10\u03c0i.\n\nHowever, I'm told the answer is Ai, where i is the imaginary unit. I'm not sure how to get A from my result.\n\nCan you help me clarify this?"

The formula states that \u222b(1 / (z - a)) dz = 2\u03c0i, but only if the contour is a simple closed curve that encloses the point a.\n\nIn my case, the contour |z| = 2 is a circle centered at the origin, and it does enclose both z = 0 and z = 1. However, I'm not sure if I should be considering the orientation of the contour.\n\nAlso, I'm integrating 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1), not just 1 / z and 1 / (z - 1). I think I should be considering the coefficients 2 and 3 in the Cauchy Integral Formula.\n\nIf I apply the Cauchy Integral Formula correctly, I should get \u222b(2 / z) dz = 2 * 2\u03c0i and \u222b(3 / (z - 1)) dz = 3 * 2\u03c0i.\n\nHowever, I'm still not sure how to get A from my result.
