Since there are 8 vertices, we can pair them up such that each face appears in exactly 4 vertices.\n\nLet's consider the pairs of opposite faces: (a, d), (b, e), and (c, f). Each vertex is the product of one face from each pair. The sum of the numbers on the vertices can be expressed as:\n\n(a + d)(b + e)(c + f) = 1001\n\nWe know that 1001 = 7 * 11 * 13. Since the numbers on the faces are positive integers, we can try to find a combination of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) that multiplies to 1001.\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. Can you give me a hint or guidance on how to find the sum of the numbers written on the faces?"

Now, let's think about the possible combinations of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) that multiply to 1001.\n\nNotice that 1001 is a relatively small number, so we can try to find combinations of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) that are also relatively small. Since the numbers on the faces are positive integers, we can start by looking for pairs of factors of 1001 that are close to each other.\n\nCan you think of any pairs of factors of 1001 that might be suitable for (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f)?"

      "content": "Since 1001 = 7 * 11 * 13, we can try to find pairs of factors that are close to each other. One possible combination is:\n\n(a + d) = 7 + 11 = 18 (no, this can't be right, since a and d are separate numbers)\n(a + d) = 7 + 13 = 20 (no, this can't be right, since a and d are separate numbers)\n(a + d) = 11 + 13 = 24 (no, this can't be right, since a and d are separate numbers)\n\nHowever, we can try to find pairs of factors that are close to each other by using the factors 7, 11, and 13 individually. For example:\n\n(a + d) = 7 + x (where x is a number that makes a + d a factor of 1001)\n(b + e) = 11 + y (where y is a number that makes b + e a factor of 1001)\n(c + f) = 13 + z (where z is a number that makes c + f a factor of 1001)\n\nBut then I realized that we can simply assign the factors 7, 11, and 13 to the pairs (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) directly. This would mean that:\n\n(a + d) = 7\n(b + e) = 11\n(c + f) = 13\n\nThis seems like a plausible solution. However, I'm not sure how to find the individual values of a, b, c, d, e, and f from here.

Think about how you can use the values of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) to set up equations for the individual values.\n\nFor example, you know that (a + d) = 7, so you can write an equation like a + d = 7.
