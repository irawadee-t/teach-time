This theorem states that the value of the integral is equal to 2\u03c0i times the sum of the residues of the poles inside the contour.\n\nIn your case, the integrand has two poles: one at z = 0 and the other at z = 1. However, the pole at z = 0 is a simple pole, while the pole at z = 1 is a pole of order 1 (since it's a zero of the denominator).\n\nTo find the residue at z = 0, you can use the formula for the residue of a simple pole: Res(f, z0) = lim(z \u2192 z0) (z - z0)f(z). In this case, Res(2/z, 0) = 2.\n\nFor the pole at z = 1, you can use the formula for the residue of a pole of order 1: Res(f, z0) = lim(z \u2192 z0) d/dz [(z - z0)^n f(z)]. In this case, Res(3/(z - 1), 1) = lim(z \u2192 1) d/dz [(z - 1) * 3/(z - 1)] = 3.\n\nNow, you have the residues, but you still need to apply the Residue Theorem.
