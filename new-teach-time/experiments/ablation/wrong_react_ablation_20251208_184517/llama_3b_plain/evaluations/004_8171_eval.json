      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor occasionally checks understanding but does so inconsistently. The questions are sometimes too generic or poorly timed, missing opportunities to delve deeper into the student's thought process."
    },
    "background_knowledge": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The tutor makes no attempt to assess the student's background knowledge at any point in the conversation. The tutor jumps straight into guiding the student through the problem without understanding the student's baseline understanding of the topic."
    },
    "guidance_level": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor provides mostly appropriate guidance, maintaining productive struggle while occasionally nudging the student towards the correct path. However, there are moments where the tutor could have allowed the student to explore more independently before stepping in."
    },
    "error_feedback": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor provides mostly explanatory feedback, guiding the student through their errors and misconceptions. However, there are moments where the feedback could be more direct in pointing out specific mistakes, such as when the student repeatedly tries the same combinations without progress."
    },
    "encouragement": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor is generally supportive and encouraging, with a positive tone throughout the conversation. However, there are minor lapses where the tutor could have been more celebratory of the student's progress or more explicitly normalized the struggle."
    },
    "coherence": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are mostly clear and coherent, with logical structure and guidance. However, there are minor moments where the tutor could have been more direct in correcting the student's repeated attempts with the same combinations, which slightly affects clarity."
    },
    "relevance": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor mostly stays on topic and addresses the student's questions, but there are minor tangents where the tutor repeats the same guidance without advancing the student's understanding significantly. The tutor does eventually help the student reach the correct solution."
    },
    "student_talk_ratio": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The student contributes a significant portion of the dialogue, actively engaging in problem-solving and attempting multiple approaches. However, the tutor occasionally steps in to guide and correct, which slightly shifts the balance."
    }

  "question_depth": {
    "score": 4,
    "question_count": {
      "recall": 0,
      "procedural": 2,
      "conceptual": 3,
      "metacognitive": 1
    },
    "justification": "The tutor's questions were well-balanced, with a strong emphasis on conceptual understanding (3 out of 6 questions) and a good mix of procedural (2 questions) and metacognitive (1 question) questions. There were no recall questions, which is positive. The tutor consistently guided the student to think deeper about the problem, especially by focusing on the prime factorization and the constraints of the problem. The metacognitive question encouraged the student to reflect on their approach, which is excellent. However, the proportion of metacognitive questions could be slightly higher to reach the 'Excellent' score. Thus, a score of 4 (Good) is appropriate."

  "icap": {
    "score": 4,
    "distribution": {
      "passive": 8,
      "active": 25,
      "constructive": 50,
      "interactive": 17
    },
    "justification": "The student's engagement was primarily constructive (50%), with significant active (25%) and interactive (17%) moments. The student frequently generated new ideas and explanations (e.g., proposing combinations of sums) and engaged in back-and-forth dialogue with the tutor (e.g., Turn 11). However, there were some passive moments (8%) where the student relied on the tutor's guidance. Overall, the student demonstrated a good mix of engagement levels, warranting a score of 4."
  },
  "summary": "This is a pedagogically effective tutoring session (scoring ~75/100) with strong engagement and feedback mechanisms, though it would benefit from better knowledge diagnostics and higher-order questioning. The ICAP distribution shows excellent constructive engagement, but passive moments could be further minimized."
