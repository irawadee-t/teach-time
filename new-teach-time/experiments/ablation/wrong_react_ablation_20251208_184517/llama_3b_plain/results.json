The integral of 2 / z is 2 * log(z), and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * log(z - 1).\n\nHowever, since this is a contour integral around the circle |z| = 2, I need to consider the residues of the poles inside the contour.

I can think of it as arranging 6 items into 3 groups, where the order of the groups matters, but the order within each group doesn't.\n\nTo calculate this, I can use the formula for permutations with grouping: (n!)/((n1)!(n2)!(n3)!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, and n3 are the number of items in each group.\n\nHowever, since I have 3 distinct objects, I need to multiply this by the number of ways to arrange the 3 objects, which is 3!.\n\nIn this case, I have 6 items (n=6), and I want to divide them into 3 groups of 2 items each (n1=n2=n3=2).

You're correct that the order within each object doesn't matter, so you need to divide the result by (2!)^3 = 8.\n\nHowever, you're also correct that you need to consider the fact that the order of the objects matters. You multiplied the result by 3! twice, but you should have only multiplied it once.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\n\n4 (female lead) * 4 (male lead) * 120 (assigning remaining members) * 3! / 8 = 4 * 4 * 120 * 6 / 8\n\nWait, you already calculated this correctly earlier. You got 1440, but the problem statement says the correct answer is 1920. What could be the issue here?\n\nLet's think about it. You correctly calculated the number of ways to assign the remaining 6 members to the 3 objects, and you correctly multiplied the result by the number of ways to choose the female lead and the male lead. However, you didn't consider the fact that the order of the female lead and the male lead matters.\n\nSince the order of the female lead and the male lead matters, you need to multiply the result by 2! (the number of ways to arrange the female lead and the male lead). So, the correct calculation is:\n\n4 (female lead) * 4 (male lead) * 120 (assigning remaining members) * 2! = 4 * 4 * 120 * 2 = 1920\n\n Ah-ha! I think I see the issue now.

The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nThe greatest common factor is the largest number in the list of common factors.

You've identified 18 as the greatest common factor, but have you considered the possibility that there might be another factor that's larger than 18? Think about the numbers that are multiples of 18.

However, 36 is not a factor of 90.\n\nIf I multiply 18 by any other number, I'll get a number larger than 18, but it won't be a factor of both 36 and 90.\n\nSo, after re-examining the factors, I'm still confident that 18 is the greatest common factor.
