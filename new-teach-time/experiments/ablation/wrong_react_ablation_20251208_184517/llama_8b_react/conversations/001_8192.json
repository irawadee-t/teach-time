      "content": "To compute the integral, I'll first try to break down the integrand into partial fractions. \n\nLet's rewrite the integrand as (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = A / z + B / (z - 1). \n\nTo find A and B, I'll multiply both sides by z * (z - 1) to get 5z - 2 = A(z - 1) + Bz.\n\nNow, I'll try to find A and B by choosing suitable values for z. If z = 0, the equation becomes -2 = -A, so A = 2. If z = 1, the equation becomes 3 = B.\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nNow, I'll integrate each term separately. The integral of 2 / z is 2 * log(z), and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * log(z - 1).\n\nHowever, since this is a contour integral around the circle |z| = 2, I'll use the Cauchy integral formula. The function 1 / z has a pole at z = 0, which is inside the contour, and the function 1 / (z - 1) has a pole at z = 1, which is also inside the contour.\n\nUsing the Cauchy integral formula, the integral of 2 / z is 2 * 2 * pi * i, and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * 2 * pi * i.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2 * 2 * pi * i + 3 * 2 * pi * i = 10 * pi * i.\n\nHowever, I'm told that the answer is Ai with i denoting the imaginary unit, where A is the answer I'm looking for. \n\nFINAL: 10 * pi"

I notice that the only difference between the two is the coefficient of i. \n\nI think the connection is that A is the coefficient of i in the result I obtained. In other words, A is the real number that multiplies i to give the result.\n\nSo, I'm going to try to extract the coefficient of i from my result. \n\n10 * pi * i is the result, and the coefficient of i is 10 * pi.\n\nFINAL: 10 * pi"

However, I notice that the given answer is Ai, where A is a real number, but I obtained 10 * pi, which is also a real number multiplied by pi.\n\nI think I need to revisit the problem and see if I made any mistakes. The given answer is Ai, which implies that A is a real number, but I obtained 10 * pi, which is a real number multiplied by pi.\n\nWait, I think I see the issue. The problem statement says that the answer is Ai, where i denotes the imaginary unit. This implies that A is a real number, and the answer is a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of A.\n\nIn that case, I think I need to revisit my previous answer and see if I can simplify it to match the given answer.\n\n10 * pi * i is the result, and I think I can simplify it by realizing that pi is a real number, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nSo, I'm going to try to simplify my answer to match the given answer.\n\nFINAL: 10 * pi"

When I multiply a real number by the imaginary unit i, the result is a purely imaginary number.\n\nSo, I can express 10 * pi * i as a purely imaginary number by realizing that 10 * pi is the real number being multiplied by i.\n\nIn this case, I can rewrite 10 * pi * i as (10 * pi)i.\n\nNow, I see that the coefficient of i is indeed 10 * pi, but I can simplify it further by realizing that the answer is in the format Ai, where A is a real number.\n\nSo, I can rewrite (10 * pi)i as 10 * pi * i, where 10 * pi is the real number A.\n\nBut wait, I think I can simplify it even further. The answer is in the format Ai, where A is a real number. In this case, I can rewrite 10 * pi * i as 10pi i.\n\nFINAL: 10pi"
