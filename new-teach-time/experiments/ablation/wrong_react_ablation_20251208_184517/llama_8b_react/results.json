If z = 0, the equation becomes -2 = -A, so A = 2. If z = 1, the equation becomes 3 = B.\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is (5z - 2) / (z * (z - 1)) = 2 / z + 3 / (z - 1).\n\nNow, I'll integrate each term separately. The integral of 2 / z is 2 * log(z), and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * log(z - 1).\n\nHowever, since this is a contour integral around the circle |z| = 2, I'll use the Cauchy integral formula. The function 1 / z has a pole at z = 0, which is inside the contour, and the function 1 / (z - 1) has a pole at z = 1, which is also inside the contour.\n\nUsing the Cauchy integral formula, the integral of 2 / z is 2 * 2 * pi * i, and the integral of 3 / (z - 1) is 3 * 2 * pi * i.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2 * 2 * pi * i + 3 * 2 * pi * i = 10 * pi * i.\n\nHowever, I'm told that the answer is Ai with i denoting the imaginary unit, where A is the answer I'm looking for. \n\nFINAL: 10 * pi",

And the number of ways to arrange these 6 members into 3 distinct roles is indeed 6P3, which is 6 * 5 * 4.\n\nHowever, I think I see a subtle point here. The number of ways to assign the remaining roles to the objects is not just 6P3. It's actually 6P3, but with the constraint that the 6 members left are the ones who were not chosen as the female lead or the male lead.\n\nBut wait, isn't that constraint already accounted for when we chose the female lead and the male lead? In other words, when we chose the female lead and the male lead, we were already selecting 2 people from the original group of 8 members. And the remaining 6 members are the ones who were not chosen.\n\nSo, in a sense, the constraint is already built into the calculation. We don't need to worry about the constraint separately. We can simply calculate the number of ways to choose the female lead and the male lead, and then multiply it by the number of ways to assign the remaining roles to the objects.\n\nAnd that's why the number of ways to choose the female lead and the male lead is independent of the number of ways to assign the remaining roles to the objects. We can calculate these two quantities separately and then multiply them together to get the total number of ways to assign the roles.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

This shows that 18 is indeed a common factor of both 36 and 90.\n\nIf we try this with the other common factors, we might find that some of them don't work as well.
