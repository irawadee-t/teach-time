  "dimensions": {
    "comprehension_probing": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor consistently probes student comprehension with targeted questions and provides guidance to help the student understand the connection between their calculations and the given answer. However, there is one missed opportunity to clarify the exact format of the answer earlier in the conversation."
    },
    "background_knowledge": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The tutor did not probe the student's background knowledge at any point during the conversation. The tutor focused on guiding the student through the solution without assessing prior understanding."
    },
    "guidance_level": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor provides mostly appropriate guidance, maintaining productive struggle while occasionally giving slightly too much help. They consistently prompt the student to think deeper without revealing answers directly."
    },
    "error_feedback": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor provides mostly explanatory feedback, guiding the student to identify and correct their errors. However, the tutor could have been more explicit in pointing out the initial confusion about the format of the answer (Ai vs. 10 * pi * i)."
    },
    "encouragement": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor's tone is generally supportive and encouraging, with positive reinforcement throughout the conversation. However, there are minor lapses where the tutor could have been more celebratory or warm, such as in Turn 8 where the feedback is more neutral."
    },
    "coherence": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are mostly clear and coherent, guiding the student effectively through the problem. However, there are minor moments where the tutor could have been more explicit, such as in Turn 6 where the hint could have been clearer to avoid the student's initial confusion."
    },
    "relevance": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses consistently and directly address the student's questions and learning needs. Each response guides the student towards understanding the connection between their result and the given answer, without any tangents or irrelevant information."
    },
    "student_talk_ratio": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The student contributes the majority of the conversational content, demonstrating deep engagement and cognitive work. The tutor's questions are well-placed to guide the student without dominating the dialogue."
    }

  "question_depth": {
    "score": 4,
    "question_count": {
      "recall": 0,
      "procedural": 0,
      "conceptual": 3,
      "metacognitive": 1
    },
    "justification": "The tutor's questions are primarily conceptual, focusing on understanding the relationship between the student's result and the given answer (e.g., connecting the coefficient of i to the answer Ai). There is also one metacognitive question that prompts the student to verify their answer against the given answer. The absence of recall or procedural questions indicates a focus on deeper understanding rather than rote memorization or step-by-step execution. However, the distribution could be improved by including more metacognitive questions (currently only 25% of the total questions) to further encourage self-reflection. Thus, the score is a 4, reflecting a good mix of question types with a strong emphasis on conceptual understanding but slightly lacking in metacognitive depth."

      "passive": 0,
      "active": 30,
      "constructive": 50,
      "interactive": 20
    },
    "justification": "The student's engagement was primarily constructive (50%) and interactive (20%), with no passive engagement and minimal active engagement (30%). The student consistently generated new ideas and explanations, and engaged in back-and-forth dialogue with the tutor. This aligns with the 'Good' (4) score, as there was a good mix of constructive and interactive engagement, with some active moments but generally high engagement."
  },
  "summary": "This was a pedagogically effective session (75/100) with strong student engagement and high-quality responses, but would benefit from better knowledge diagnostics and more varied questioning strategies. The tutor excelled at maintaining relevance and fostering active learning, though foundational knowledge checks were notably absent."
