  "dimensions": {
    "comprehension_probing": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor occasionally checks understanding but does so inconsistently. The questions are somewhat generic and poorly timed, often repeating the same prompt without deeper probing or guidance."
    },
    "background_knowledge": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The tutor makes no attempt to assess the student's background knowledge at any point in the conversation. The tutor jumps straight into correcting the student's work without understanding the student's baseline understanding of the topic."
    },
    "guidance_level": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor mostly provides appropriate guidance by prompting the student to think carefully about the application of the residue theorem and the manipulation of complex numbers. However, there are instances where the tutor repeats prompts without adding new insights, which slightly reduces the effectiveness."
    },
    "error_feedback": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor acknowledges the student's errors and attempts to guide them, but the feedback is repetitive and lacks detailed explanations. The tutor frequently says 'Let's think about this more carefully' without providing concrete guidance or correcting specific misconceptions."
    },
    "encouragement": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor's tone is generally neutral with occasional attempts at guidance, but lacks consistent warmth or encouragement. The repeated phrase 'Let's think about this more carefully' is not harsh but becomes mechanical and unhelpful over time."
    },
    "coherence": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are somewhat unclear and repetitive, often failing to provide new insights or correct the student's confusion directly. The repeated phrase 'Let's think about this more carefully' does not add clarity or structure to the discussion."
    },
    "relevance": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The tutor frequently provides irrelevant or repetitive responses, failing to address the student's confusion effectively. The tutor repeatedly suggests thinking more carefully without offering new insights or corrections, which does not help the student resolve their misunderstanding."
    },
    "student_talk_ratio": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The student is actively engaging with the problem and attempting to apply the residue theorem, but there is confusion about the final step of isolating A. The tutor provides guidance but the student struggles to fully grasp the concept, indicating an adequate but not excellent balance."
    }
  },
  "question_depth": {
    "score": 2,
    "question_count": {
      "recall": 0,
      "procedural": 0,
      "conceptual": 1,
      "metacognitive": 0
    },
    "justification": "The tutor's questions were very limited and primarily focused on procedural and conceptual aspects, with only one conceptual question identified ('Can you think of how to apply this to your problem?'). There were no recall or metacognitive questions, and the tutor did not encourage deeper thinking or reflection. The lack of variety and depth in questioning, along with the repetitive nature of the questions, justifies a score of 2 (Poor)."

  "icap": {
    "score": 3,
    "distribution": {
      "passive": 10,
      "active": 30,
      "constructive": 50,
      "interactive": 10
    },
    "justification": "The student demonstrates a high level of constructive engagement, consistently working through the problem and attempting to correct their understanding. However, the tutor's prompts become increasingly passive, which limits the interactive potential of the conversation. The student's engagement is primarily constructive (50%), with some active (30%) and minimal passive (10%) and interactive (10%) moments. The score of 3 reflects adequate engagement, as the student is mostly active and constructive but could benefit from more interactive guidance to deepen their understanding."
  },
  "summary": "This session provided adequate support with strong constructive engagement and appropriate guidance, but suffered from weak background assessment and shallow question diversity. Focus on foundational knowledge checks and deeper questioning would significantly improve effectiveness."
