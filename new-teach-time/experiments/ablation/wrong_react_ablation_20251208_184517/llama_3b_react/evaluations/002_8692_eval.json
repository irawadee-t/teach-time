  "dimensions": {
    "comprehension_probing": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor occasionally checks understanding but does so inconsistently and with poor timing. The questions are not targeted enough to reveal deep comprehension gaps, and the tutor misses multiple opportunities to clarify the student's repeated mistakes."
    },
    "background_knowledge": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The tutor makes no attempt to assess the student's prior knowledge about proportions or solving for variables. The tutor jumps straight into correcting the student's work without understanding the student's baseline understanding."
    },
    "guidance_level": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor's guidance is inconsistent. While they initially provide appropriate scaffolding (e.g., 'Can you simplify the proportion and solve for x?'), they later repeatedly give vague prompts ('Let's think about this more carefully') without addressing the student's specific errors or providing targeted hints. This leads to confusion and repetition without productive struggle."
    },
    "error_feedback": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The tutor mostly repeats 'Let's think about this more carefully' without providing clear, explanatory feedback on the student's errors. The feedback lacks constructive guidance on why the student's approach was incorrect and how to correct it."
    },
    "encouragement": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor's tone is mostly neutral, with occasional attempts at encouragement, but lacks consistent warmth or celebration of progress. The repeated phrase 'Let's think about this more carefully' becomes mechanical and does not provide constructive guidance or positive reinforcement."
    },
    "coherence": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are somewhat unclear and repetitive, often failing to provide direct guidance or correction when the student makes errors. The repeated phrase 'Let's think about this more carefully' without specific direction leads to confusion rather than clarity."
    },
    "relevance": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are inconsistent in addressing the student's needs. While some responses guide the student correctly (e.g., Turn 2), others are repetitive and unhelpful (e.g., 'Let's think about this more carefully' in Turns 6, 8, 10, etc.). The tutor fails to correct the student's repeated mistakes effectively, leading to confusion."
    },
    "student_talk_ratio": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The student contributes a significant portion of the dialogue, but there are repetitive and redundant sections where the student seems stuck. The tutor's prompts are minimal and sometimes repetitive ('Let's think about this more carefully'), which does not always guide the student effectively. The student does most of the cognitive work but struggles with clarity and efficiency."

  "question_depth": {

    "question_count": {
      "recall": 0,
      "procedural": 1,
      "conceptual": 0,
      "metacognitive": 0
    },
    "justification": "The tutor's questioning was very limited and primarily focused on procedural aspects (e.g., solving the proportion). There were no recall, conceptual, or metacognitive questions asked. The lack of deeper questioning (conceptual or metacognitive) and the minimal engagement with the student's thought process (only one procedural question) justify a score of 2 (Poor). The tutor did not push for deeper understanding or reflection, and the conversation was dominated by the student's repeated attempts to correct their own mistakes without meaningful guidance."

    "distribution": {
      "passive": 20,
      "active": 40,
      "constructive": 30,
      "interactive": 10
    },
    "justification": "The student initially demonstrates constructive engagement by proposing multiple methods to solve the problem (Turn 1). However, as the conversation progresses, the student frequently revisits and re-examines the proportion, showing active engagement in rehearsing the steps (Turns 3, 5, 9). There are moments of constructive engagement when the student attempts to correct mistakes and re-evaluate the solution (Turns 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21). The interactive engagement is minimal, with limited back-and-forth dialogue with the tutor. The student's engagement is primarily active with some constructive moments, but there are significant periods of passive engagement when the student repeats the same steps without progress. Overall, the engagement is adequate but lacks depth in interactive and higher-level constructive engagement."
  },
  "summary": "This tutoring session demonstrates adequate pedagogical effectiveness with balanced engagement and moderate guidance, but it lacks depth in questioning and foundational knowledge checks. Strengthening error feedback and incorporating higher-order questions would significantly enhance learning outcomes."
