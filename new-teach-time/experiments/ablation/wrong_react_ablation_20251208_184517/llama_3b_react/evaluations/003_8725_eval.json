  "dimensions": {
    "comprehension_probing": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The tutor rarely probes comprehension effectively. Most of the tutor's responses are repetitive and do not ask targeted questions to verify understanding or guide the student's thinking. The tutor misses multiple opportunities to clarify or deepen the student's understanding."
    },
    "background_knowledge": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The tutor makes no attempt to assess the student's background knowledge at any point in the conversation. The tutor jumps straight into correcting the student's approach without first understanding the student's baseline understanding of permutations and combinations."
    },
    "guidance_level": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The tutor frequently repeats the same prompt ('Let's think about this more carefully') without providing specific guidance or scaffolding. This leaves the student to repeatedly re-examine their work without clear direction, which is not productive scaffolding."
    },
    "error_feedback": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The tutor repeatedly fails to provide explanatory feedback or clarify the student's confusion. The tutor's responses are vague and do not address the specific errors or misconceptions in the student's reasoning."
    },
    "encouragement": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The tutor's tone is cold and mechanical, repeating the same phrase without providing constructive feedback or encouragement. The lack of positive reinforcement or acknowledgment of the student's efforts makes the interaction feel frustrating and unhelpful."
    },
    "coherence": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are frequently unclear and repetitive, failing to provide meaningful guidance or clarification. The repeated phrase 'Let's think about this more carefully' does not help the student progress or understand the problem better."
    },
    "relevance": {
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are repetitive and do not provide meaningful guidance or clarification to the student's repeated requests for help. The tutor fails to address the student's evolving understanding and instead repeats the same non-helpful phrase."
    },
    "student_talk_ratio": {
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The student is actively engaging in the problem-solving process and attempts to correct their approach multiple times, but there is significant repetition and confusion. The tutor's guidance is minimal and repetitive, not effectively steering the student towards clarity."

  "question_depth": {
    "score": 3,
    "question_count": {
      "recall": 0,
      "procedural": 1,
      "conceptual": 0,
      "metacognitive": 0
    },
    "justification": "The tutor's questioning is limited and repetitive, primarily focusing on procedural aspects (e.g., how to calculate combinations). There is no evidence of conceptual or metacognitive questioning, and the tutor repeats the same prompt ('Let's think about this more carefully') without deepening the inquiry. While the initial procedural question is valid, the lack of follow-up or varied questioning limits the depth of the interaction. The conversation does not meet the criteria for higher scores due to the absence of conceptual or metacognitive engagement and the repetitive nature of the tutor's prompts."

      "passive": 6.25,
      "active": 31.25,
      "constructive": 62.5,
      "interactive": 0
    },
    "justification": "The student demonstrates a high level of constructive engagement (62.5%) by consistently re-evaluating and refining their approach to the problem. However, there is no interactive engagement as the student does not build on the tutor's prompts or engage in a back-and-forth dialogue. The active engagement (31.25%) is seen when the student responds to the tutor's prompts with recalculations. The passive engagement (6.25%) occurs when the tutor prompts without a student response. Overall, the student is engaged but lacks interaction with the tutor, leading to a score of 3 (Adequate)."
  },
  "summary": "This tutoring session shows adequate pedagogical effectiveness with strong constructive engagement but suffers from limited question variety and weak foundational support. While students are actively processing information, the interaction lacks depth-building techniques and personalized feedback needed for higher-order learning."
