      "content": "To find the number of minutes for Susan to read 18 pages, I think we can use a proportion or a multiplication method. Since Susan reads 1 page every 3 minutes, we can set up a proportion to relate the number of pages to the number of minutes.\n\nLet's say the number of minutes to read 18 pages is x. We can set up the proportion as follows:\n\n1 page / 3 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes\n\nWe can then cross-multiply and solve for x.\n\nAlternatively, we can also use a multiplication method. Since Susan reads 1 page every 3 minutes, we can multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to read one page.\n\n18 pages * 3 minutes/page = x minutes\n\nI'm not sure which method is more efficient, but I think both methods should give us the same answer."

I'm going to check my answer using the multiplication method to make sure it's correct.\n\n18 pages * 3 minutes/page = 54 minutes\n\nYes, both methods give the same answer.
