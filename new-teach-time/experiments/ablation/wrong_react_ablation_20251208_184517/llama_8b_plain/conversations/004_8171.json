      "content": "Let's denote the numbers on the six faces as a, b, c, d, e, and f. Each vertex is the product of three adjacent faces. Since there are eight vertices, we can pair them up such that each face appears in exactly four vertices. \n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to the sum of the products of the three adjacent faces. We can pair the vertices as follows: (a, b, c) and (d, e, f), (a, b, f) and (d, e, c), (a, e, c) and (d, b, f), and (a, e, f) and (d, b, c).\n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is then: \n(a + d)(b + e)(c + f) = 1001.\n\nSince 1001 = 7 * 11 * 13, we can deduce that (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) are equal to 7, 11, and 13 in some order.\n\nNow, I'm unsure about how to proceed from here. Should we try to find the individual values of a, b, c, d, e, and f, or is there a simpler way to find their sum?"

      "content": "You've made great progress in factoring 1001 and identifying the possible values for (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f). Now, think about how the sum of the numbers on the faces relates to the values you've found. Can you express the sum of the faces in terms of (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f)?"

We can rearrange this sum as (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f).\n\nSince we know that (a + d), (b + e), and (c + f) are equal to 7, 11, and 13 in some order, we can simply add these values together to find the sum of the numbers on the faces.\n\nSo, the sum of the numbers on the faces is 7 + 11 + 13 = 31.\n\nFINAL: 31"
