The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nThe greatest common factor is the largest number in this list. I think the GCF is 18, but I'm not entirely sure if I've done it correctly.\n\nCould you please confirm or provide more guidance?"

    {
      "role": "student",
      "content": "I think I understand what you're getting at. The greatest common factor isn't necessarily the number that appears most frequently in the list of common factors. Instead, it's the largest number that appears in both lists of factors.\n\nIn other words, the GCF is the largest number that divides both 36 and 90 without leaving a remainder. With that in mind, I'm going to re-examine the list of common factors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nSince 18 is the largest number in this list, I'm confident that it's the greatest common factor of 36 and 90.\n\nFINAL: 18"
