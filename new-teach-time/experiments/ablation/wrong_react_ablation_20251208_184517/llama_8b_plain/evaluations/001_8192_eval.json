  "dimensions": {
    "comprehension_probing": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor consistently checks the student's understanding with targeted questions, especially when clarifying the form of the answer (Ai) and the numerical evaluation (31.4). However, there was a missed opportunity to probe the student's initial uncertainty about the correctness of their approach."
    },
    "background_knowledge": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "The tutor makes no attempt to assess the student's background knowledge at any point in the conversation. The tutor jumps straight into addressing the student's solution without understanding the student's baseline understanding of the topic."
    },
    "guidance_level": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor provides mostly appropriate guidance, maintaining productive struggle while occasionally giving slightly too much help. The tutor effectively prompts the student to think about expressing the integral in the form Ai and later to consider the numerical value, but does not reveal the answer directly."
    },
    "error_feedback": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The tutor provides explanatory feedback that helps the student understand their errors and guides them toward the correct solution. However, the initial feedback could have been more direct about the numerical evaluation of \u03c0."
    },
    "encouragement": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The tutor consistently uses warm, encouraging language, celebrates progress, and maintains student motivation. The tone is supportive and positive throughout the conversation."
    },
    "coherence": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are crystal clear, logically structured, and easy to follow. Each response builds on the student's previous answer, guiding them step-by-step to the correct solution without any confusion or ambiguity."
    },
    "relevance": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "The tutor's responses are consistently relevant and directly address the student's questions and learning needs. Each response builds on the student's previous statements, clarifies misunderstandings, and guides the student toward the correct solution without any tangents or irrelevant information."
    },
    "student_talk_ratio": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The student actively contributes to the conversation by breaking down the integrand and applying the Cauchy Integral Formula, but initially misses the numerical evaluation. The tutor guides the student to the correct interpretation, ensuring a balanced dialogue."
    }

  "question_depth": {
    "score": 4,
    "question_count": {
      "recall": 0,
      "procedural": 0,
      "conceptual": 2,
      "metacognitive": 0
    },
    "justification": "The tutor's questions were focused on conceptual understanding, guiding the student to connect their mathematical expression to the problem's requirements. Both questions encouraged the student to think about the relationship between their derived result (10\u03c0i) and the desired form (Ai), as well as the numerical interpretation (31.4). However, there were no metacognitive questions to prompt reflection on the student's problem-solving process, and no recall or procedural questions were asked. The emphasis on conceptual questions (100% of the questions) is strong, but the lack of metacognitive questioning prevents a score of 5. Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate, reflecting a good mix with a focus on deeper understanding but missing the metacognitive layer."

      "passive": 0,
      "active": 16.67,
      "constructive": 50,
      "interactive": 33.33
    },
    "justification": "The student's engagement is primarily constructive (50%) and interactive (33.33%), with minimal passive engagement (0%) and some active engagement (16.67%). The student consistently generates new ideas and explanations (constructive) and engages in back-and-forth dialogue with the tutor (interactive). The tutor's prompts also encourage interactive engagement. The distribution aligns with a score of 4 (Good) as there is a good mix of constructive and interactive engagement, with some active moments (e.g., Turn 6 where the tutor summarizes the solution)."
  },
  "summary": "This is a pedagogically effective tutoring session (scoring ~85/100) with strong engagement and feedback quality, but would benefit from better knowledge diagnostics and more varied questioning strategies to deepen learning."
