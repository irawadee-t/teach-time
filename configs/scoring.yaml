# AppBench-style Scoring Configuration

# Overall weights for score components
weights:
  pedagogy: 0.4
  learning: 0.4
  quality: 0.2

# Pedagogy targets (best practices from tutoring literature)
pedagogy:
  # Student talk ratio should be between 0.5 and 0.8
  # (student should talk about half the time or more)
  student_talk_ratio_range: [0.5, 0.8]

  # Target number of questions per session
  # Encourages active learning through questioning
  target_questions_per_session: 5

  # Background/prior knowledge should be probed by this turn
  # Early assessment helps tutor adapt to student level
  background_asked_by_turn: 3

  # Target number of understanding checks per session
  # Regular checks ensure comprehension before moving forward
  target_understanding_checks: 3

# Learning thresholds
learning:
  # Minimum acceptable normalized learning gain
  min_learning_gain: 0.1

  # "Good" learning gain threshold (for full score)
  good_learning_gain: 0.3

# Quality assessment
quality:
  # Whether to use LLM-as-judge for quality scoring
  use_llm_judge: false  # Set to true when ready to use

  # Model to use for LLM-as-judge
  judge_model: "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo"

  # Quality dimensions
  dimensions:
    - pedagogical_usefulness
