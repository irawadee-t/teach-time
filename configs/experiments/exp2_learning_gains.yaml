# Experiment 2: Learning Gains on Simulated Students
#
# Goal: Measure whether metric-aware ReAct-Teacher improves learning outcomes
# compared to baselines. Uses simulated students with internal knowledge state
# and pre/post quizzes.

# Output
description: |
  Compare agents on learning outcomes. For each episode:
  1. Administer pre-quiz
  2. Run tutoring session
  3. Administer post-quiz
  4. Compute learning gain

  Analyze:
  - Distribution of learning gains per agent
  - Mean and std of gain, effect sizes
  - Breakdown by student persona
