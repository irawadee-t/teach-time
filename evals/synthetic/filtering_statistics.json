  "common_strengths": [
    "Maintains an encouraging, validating tone while correcting the student's error",
    "Validates the student's reasoning as sophisticated rather than dismissing it, building confidence while correcting the misconception",
    "Uses an effective, relatable analogy (cooking during financial hardship) that clearly illustrates the distinction between enabling conditions and direct causation",
    "Appropriate pedagogical approach with positive reinforcement and a thought-provoking follow-up question",
    "Uses multiple effective pedagogical tools: analogies, concrete examples, and a thought-provoking closing question",
    "Maintains excellent balance between mathematical rigor and conceptual clarity, showing key equations while prioritizing understanding",
    "Maintains an encouraging tone while thoroughly correcting the misconception, validating the student's reasoning attempt",
    "Uses an excellent guitar string analogy that makes the abstract concept concrete and relatable",
    "Uses multiple effective analogies (library card, street address) that make abstract concepts concrete and relatable",
    "Explains the practical implications of the MRP=MC rule in real-world decision-making"

  "common_weaknesses": [
    "The explanation of why lies become ineffective in a universal lying world could be slightly more developed",
    "The calculation showing $15,000 growing to $24,157 could have been shown explicitly (15,000 × 1.10^5) for students who want to verify the math",
    "The response is somewhat lengthy, though the detail is appropriate for the complexity of the topic",
    "Could have briefly mentioned that foreign key constraints also prevent orphaned records (referential integrity enforcement) to connect back to the original explanation",
    "Could have briefly mentioned the distinction between 'monadic' and 'dyadic' versions of democratic peace theory for more advanced understanding",
    "The response is somewhat lengthy, though the content is relevant and well-organized",
    "Could have more explicitly shown the student's calculation error step-by-step before showing the correct method",
    "The initial explanation's omission of worst-case complexity could have been more explicitly acknowledged as an oversight",
    "Could have briefly acknowledged why the student's confusion is understandable (e.g., many longitudinal studies happen to be correlational)",
    "The rhetorical question about what determines allele frequency lists factors but doesn't elaborate on them, which might leave the student wanting more explanation"
