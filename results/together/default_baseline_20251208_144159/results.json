The concentration of HA will be:\n\\[ [HA] = 0.100 - 1.36 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.100 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n(We can approximate because \\(1.36 \\times 10^{-3}\\) is very small compared to 0.100 M.)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\(K_a\\)\nUsing the expression for \\(K_a\\):\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]} \\]\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{(1.36 \\times 10^{-3})(1.36 \\times 10^{-3})}{0.100} \\]\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{(1.36 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{0.100} \\]\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{1.85 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.100} \\]\n\\[ K_a \\approx 1.85 \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Percent Ionization\nThe percent ionization is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Percent Ionization} = \\left( \\frac{[H^+]}{[\\text{initial HA}]} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percent Ionization} = \\left( \\frac{1.36 \\times 10^{-3}}{0.100} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percent Ionization} \\approx 1.36\\% \\]\n\n### Step 5: Effect of Dilution\nWhen the solution is diluted to half its original concentration, the new concentration of HA becomes 0.050 M. However, the equilibrium will shift to re-establish the concentration of H\u207a and A\u207b due to Le Chatelier's principle. The system will try to counteract the dilution by producing more H\u207a and A\u207b.\n\n### Justification Using Le Chatelier's Principle\nLe Chatelier's principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium will shift to counteract the change. When the solution is diluted, the concentration of HA decreases, which shifts the equilibrium to the right, producing more H\u207a and A\u207b. Therefore, the concentration of H\u207a and A\u207b will increase, and the percent ionization will also increase.\n\n### Summary\n- \\(K_a \\approx 1.85 \\times 10^{-5}\\)\n- Percent Ionization \\(\\approx 1.36\\%\\)\n- When the solution is diluted, the percent ionization will increase because the equilibrium shifts to produce more H\u207a and A\u207b to counteract the dilution.",

The strength of an acid in water is influenced by the stability of the conjugate base that is formed after the acid donates a proton.\n\nHere's the key point: the strength of the acid is not directly related to the electronegativity of the halogen (F, Cl, I) in the molecule. Instead, it's more about the size of the halogen and the ability of the conjugate base to stabilize the negative charge after the proton is donated.\n\n1. **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid)**: This is the strongest acid among the three. When HCl donates a proton, the Cl- ion is the conjugate base. Chlorine is small and can stabilize the negative charge well due to its compact size and ability to hold the negative charge close to itself.\n\n2. **HF (Hydrofluoric Acid)**: Fluorine is even smaller than chlorine, and the F- ion can also stabilize the negative charge effectively. However, the hydrogen fluoride molecule is less polarizable than HCl, which means it's harder for the H+ to be released. So, HF is a weaker acid than HCl but stronger than HI.\n\n3. **HI (Hydroiodic Acid)**: Iodine is the largest of the three halogens. The I- ion is less effective at stabilizing the negative charge because of its larger size. This makes HI the weakest acid among the three.\n\nSo, the correct order from strongest to weakest acid is:\n- HCl > HF > HI\n\nThis order is consistent with the ability of the conjugate bases to stabilize the negative charge after the proton is donated.

However, in this case, the problem specifies that the oxygen gas was collected over water, which means the oxygen gas is in a mixture with water vapor. The total pressure of 755 mmHg includes both the oxygen and the water vapor. To find the partial pressure of oxygen (O\u2082), you need to subtract the vapor pressure of water (24 mmHg) from the total pressure (755 mmHg).

Here, the distance is \\( d \\).\n\nThe torque due to the applied force \\( F \\) is:\n\\[ \\tau_F = F \\cdot d \\]\n\nThe torque due to static friction \\(\\tau_{\\text{friction}}\\) is:\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{friction}} = \\mu_s \\cdot N \\cdot r_{cm} \\]\n\nHere, \\( N \\) is the normal force, which is equal to the weight of the object \\( M \\cdot g \\), and \\( r_{cm} \\) is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass of the object.

The maximum static friction force is given by:\n\\[ F_{\\text{max, friction}} = \\mu_s \\cdot N = \\mu_s \\cdot M \\cdot g \\]\n\nIf the applied force \\( F \\) exceeds this value, the object will start to slide.

The frictional force does indeed act in a direction that resists the rotation of the disk, so the torque due to friction should be subtracted from the torque due to the string. Let's go through the steps again to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Calculate the torque due to the string:**\n   The torque (\\(\\tau_{\\text{string}}\\)) is given by the force times the radius of the disk:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_{\\text{string}} = F \\cdot r = 10 \\, \\text{N} \\cdot 0.5 \\, \\text{m} = 5 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n   \\]\n   This torque is in the direction that causes the disk to rotate.\n\n2. **Calculate the torque due to friction:**\n   The frictional force (\\(f\\)) is given by the coefficient of kinetic friction (\\(\\mu_k\\)) times the normal force (\\(N\\)). The normal force is the weight of the block (\\(m_{\\text{block}} \\cdot g\\)):\n   \\[\n   f = \\mu_k \\cdot m_{\\text{block}} \\cdot g = 0.2 \\cdot 1 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot 10 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 2 \\, \\text{N}\n   \\]\n   The torque due to friction (\\(\\tau_{\\text{friction}}\\)) is the frictional force times the distance from the center to the block:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_{\\text{friction}} = f \\cdot r_{\\text{block}} = 2 \\, \\text{N} \\cdot 0.4 \\, \\text{m} = 0.8 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n   \\]\n   Since the block is sliding outward, the frictional force acts in the direction opposite to the rotation of the disk, so the torque is negative:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_{\\text{friction}} = -0.8 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the net torque:**\n   The net torque (\\(\\tau_{\\text{net}}\\)) is the sum of the torques from the string and the friction:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_{\\text{net}} = \\tau_{\\text{string}} + \\tau_{\\text{friction}} = 5 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m} - 0.8 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m} = 4.2 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the moment of inertia of the disk:**\n   The moment of inertia (\\(I\\)) of a disk about its center is:\n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{1}{2} m_{\\text{disk}} r^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot (0.5 \\, \\text{m})^2 = 0.25 \\, \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the angular acceleration:**\n   The angular acceleration (\\(\\alpha\\)) is given by the net torque divided by the moment of inertia:\n   \\[\n   \\alpha = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{net}}}{I} = \\frac{4.2 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}}{0.25 \\, \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2} = 16.8 \\, \\text{rad/s}^2\n   \\]\n\nSo, the angular acceleration of the disk right after the force is applied is \\(16.8 \\, \\text{rad/s}^2\\).
