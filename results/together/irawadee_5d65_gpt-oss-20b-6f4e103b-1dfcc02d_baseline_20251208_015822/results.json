HCl has a weaker bond, and HI the weakest. |\n| **Size of the X atom** | Larger atoms make longer bonds, which are easier to break | F is tiny \u2192 short, strong bond. I is huge \u2192 long, weak bond. |\n| **Conjugate base stability (X\u207b)** | After H\u207a leaves, the negative charge must be stable | The larger the base, the better it can spread out the negative charge (delocalization). I\u207b is the most stable, F\u207b the least. |\n| **Solvation in water** | Water can stabilize the negative charge by hydrogen bonding | Larger anions are better solvated, which further stabilizes them. |\n\n### Putting it together\n\n1. **HF**  \n   * Very short, strong H\u2013F bond \u2192 hard to break.  \n   * Very small F\u207b cannot spread out charge well \u2192 unstable.  \n   * Result: HF hardly donates H\u207a \u2192 weakest acid.\n\n2. **HCl**  \n   * H\u2013Cl bond is longer and weaker than H\u2013F \u2192 easier to break.  \n   * Cl\u207b is larger than F\u207b and can hold the negative charge better \u2192 more stable.  \n   * Result: HCl is a stronger acid than HF.\n\n3. **HI**  \n   * H\u2013I bond is the longest and weakest \u2192 easiest to break.  \n   * I\u207b is the largest, spreads the charge most effectively, and is very well solvated by water.  \n   * Result: HI is the strongest acid among the three.\n\n---\n\n## Why electronegativity (EN) isn\u2019t the deciding factor\n\nYour intuition about electronegativity is understandable: a more electronegative atom pulls electrons toward itself, which could make it easier to release a proton. However, in this series:\n\n- Fluorine is indeed the most electronegative, but it also forms a *very strong* H\u2013F bond.  \n- Chlorine is less electronegative, but its larger size weakens the H\u2013Cl bond enough that it can donate H\u207a more readily.  \n- Iodine is the least electronegative, yet its huge size makes the H\u2013I bond the weakest and its conjugate base the most stabilized.\n\nSo, while EN does influence acid strength, it is **not** the sole or even the dominant factor for these halogen acids. The bond strength (which itself depends on atom size and overlap) and the stability of the conjugate base are far more decisive.\n\n---\n\n## Quick mnemonic\n\n> **HF** (tiny, strong bond, weak base) \u2192 **weakest**  \n> **HCl** (middle size, easier bond, more stable base) \u2192 **medium**  \n> **HI** (large, weak bond, very stable base) \u2192 **strongest**\n\n---\n\n### What to remember next time\n\n1. **Look at the H\u2013X bond energy** \u2013 weaker bonds \u2192 stronger acids.  \n2. **Consider the size of the X atom** \u2013 bigger atoms \u2192 longer, weaker bonds and better charge dispersion.  \n3. **Don\u2019t rely solely on electronegativity** \u2013 it\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nFeel free to ask if you want a deeper dive into any of these points or if you\u2019d like to see how this works for other groups of acids!",
